# Exercise-Tracker 

Program Author ~ Aranesh Athavan 

PURPOSE  
--------- 

The puropse of the program is to demonstrate my understadning of web development 
of both front end and back end. This is A MERN stack project that keeps track  
of the persons fitness. Since I am a passionate programmer that wants to challenge 
myself to learn new concepts in the programming world I decided to take multiple 
tutorials on youtube that taught me how to develop web projects. This app is 
a demonstration of the skills of MERN stack that I learned through 
multiple youtube viddeos and the video covering how to develop a MERN stack 
project. 

This app keeps track of the users fitness through storing the data of multiple users and 
the data they performed the activity and the description of the activity.
